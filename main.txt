Git Workflow:
Git by its very nature encourages (forces) of comunication between teammates
especially starting off. It also saves you from yourself as far as breaking
important things by enforcing a strict workflow. Such that whenever you have
modify a file you have to add it to git (git add) and then commit it. Commits
are logged by unique hashes so that you can revert to any previous commit if
need be. Once you are satisfied with your files you can push them to the
master repo assuming you have the necessary permission and that there are no
conflicts. If there any conflicts you must merge any files with conflicts and manually
resolve them. Once this is done you can push and pull at your leasure.
Repositories can also be branched to work on yourself and the submitted via a
pull request to be merged with the master repo again.
