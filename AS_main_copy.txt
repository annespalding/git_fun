Hi, this is your Git file.  Answer the following:

1. My name is : Carl "Tiberious" Nesbit and Jared Cahalan and Abel
2. My teammates names are: Scott Childers, Abel Sanche, Jared Cahalan, James T. Kirk
3. My favorite programming language is :Either Python, because it has "pie" in the name, or Visual Basic.NET, because everyone else hates it. We like python because snakes are just cool.
4. The name of my semester long mobile application is : Visual Keeper


Phase1
Figuring out the merge was the most trouble we had with the first phase workflow. There were some troubles with doing commits but not doing pushes.

Phase2
My image file is sand_dunes.jpg - Jared
Abel - My file is named fun_image.jpeg

This workflow was better than the last it was easier to separate the things people were doing. The .gitignore file was easy to set up. The .gitignore file is perfect for ignoring testing data files or executables.

The Phase 2 workflow of forking went significantly better along with the permission establishing and resyncing the files after the pull requests were a approved. I  now have a way etter appreciation for the shell interface and the gui on mac. The .gitignore is a way to specify which files should be ignored for upload. Files that are necessary in the creation of the project on your machone but not so important for other people to have access to is where the .gitignore comes into play.
